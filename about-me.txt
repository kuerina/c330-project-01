Welcome to my website!

My name is Hugo Trivino, I am originally from Patagonia Chile. When I finish highschool I could not 
go to college right away because two of my siblings were already studying so I left my hometown at the age of 17
to work about 2000 miles north of Patagonia to the Atacama desert, the driest place on the planet! I worked on different
 service companies (Sodexo, Compass-Group) giving services to the workers at a huge mining project.

I consider myself a deep learner passionate about prepare myself to confront hard problems with simple solutions.
Computer engineering has taugh me how hardware makes possible programability from a bottom-up perspective
, and so far my favorite programming language has been MC68k because I can understand more or less the
process needed to perform an instruction. Once languages are lost in abstraction, it is far harder to keep
up with the actual implementation of our programs and time complexity becomes really an issue.

Since humans make problems easier to understand (or harder) by using abstractions, it is imperative to learn
how to deal with it. For this reason I am complementing my engineering degree with a masters in Computer science. 
I hope I can use my understanding of hardware to make abstract problems faster to compute. The facinating
problems that I hope to learn from computer science are the ones found in datamining, social network analysis,
machine learning, and artificial intelligence.
