        Welcome to my website!

    <h2 class="headers">A little Background</h2>

    <p class="paragraph">
        My name is Hugo Trivino, and I am a computer scientist and engineer from
        Chilean Patagonia. I joined the workforce at a young age and had to
        delay a college degree because my family could only afford to send my
        oldest two siblings to college.After I graduated high school at age 17,
        I left Patagonia and traveled some two thousand miles north to the
        Atacama desert, the driest place on the planet! For the next six years,
        I worked for different mining service companies including Sodexo,
        Compass-Group, and Esperanza, where I got my first taste of programming.

    <h2 class="headers">Let's Talk About My Passion</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
        Working on one of the largest copper mine projects in the world, I was
        presented with design challenges on a daily basis. In order to solve
        some of the problems I faced, I taught myself how to program so I could
        do the most efficient and reliable work possible. Later at IIT, I
        learned how to formalize my self taught skills and discover the
        intricacies of hardware design. I want to use my understanding of
        hardware design to make abstract problems faster to compute. I hope that
        at the end of my course work at IIT I have the skills to address the
        fascinating problems found in data mining, social network analysis,
        machine learning, and artificial intelligence.</p>
    <h2 class="headers">So, What About Web Design?</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
        All around the world there are people that share my passion for these
        growing challenges, and the web is a perfect spot where all these
        interests can converge and interact. That is why being a creative web
        designer is so important. With superior web design skills, I will be
        able to communicate ideas in the most flexible and personalized manner
        to people from all different backgrounds and experiences. In order to
        communicate with the world and have the greatest impact there is hardly
        a more powerful tool that web development.
