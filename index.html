<h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
<h2>A little Background</h2>
<p>My name is Hugo Trivino, and I am a computer scientist and engineer from Chilean Patagonia.
    I joined the workforce at a young age and had to delay a college degree because my family could only afford to send my oldest two siblings to college.
    After I graduated high school at age 17, I left Patagonia and traveled some two thousand miles north to the Atacama desert, the driest place on the planet!
    For the next six years, I worked for different mining service companies including Sodexo, Compass-Group, and Esperanza, where I got my first taste of programming. </p>    
<h2>Let's Talk About My Passion</h2>
<p>Working on one of the largest copper mine projects in the world, I was presented with design challenges on a daily basis.
    In order to solve some of the problems I faced, I taught myself how to program so I could do the most efficient and reliable work possible.
    Later at IIT, I learned how to formalize my self taught skills and discover the intricacies of hardware design. I want to use my understanding
     of hardware design to make abstract problems faster to compute. I hope that at the end of my course work at IIT I have the skills to 
    address the fascinating problems found in data mining, social network analysis, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.</p>
<h2>So, What About Web Design?</h2>
<p>All around the world there are people that share my passion for these growing challenges, and the web is a perfect spot where all these interests can converge and interact.
    That is why being a creative web designer is so important. With superior web design skills, I will be able to communicate ideas in the most flexible and personalized
    manner to people from all different backgrounds and experiences. If we want to communicate with the worlds having the greatest impact, web design is one of the most powerful tools we have at our disposal.
